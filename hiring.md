# Hiring Process

At Helixiora, we are committed to attracting and selecting top talent to join our team. This section provides an overview of our hiring process, from job postings to onboarding.

## Job Postings

When a position becomes available, we post detailed job descriptions on our company website and other relevant platforms. These postings outline the job requirements, responsibilities, and desired qualifications.

## Application and Resume Screening

Once applications are received, our team carefully reviews each resume and application. Candidates who meet the initial requirements will be selected for further consideration.

## Interviews

Selected candidates will be invited to participate in interviews, which may include phone interviews, video interviews, and in-person interviews. The purpose of these interviews is to assess candidates' qualifications, skills, and cultural fit within our organization.

## Reference Checks

As part of our thorough selection process, we conduct reference checks for final candidates. These checks provide valuable insights into a candidate's past work experience, performance, and professional reputation.

## Offer and Onboarding

Upon successfully completing the interview and reference check process, a formal job offer will be extended to the selected candidate. Once the offer is accepted, our HR team will guide the new employee through the onboarding process, which includes completing necessary paperwork, setting up access to systems, and providing an orientation to the company.
