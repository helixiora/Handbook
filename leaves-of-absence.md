# Leaves of Absence

At Helixiora, we recognize the importance of work-life balance and support our employees during various life events. This section outlines our policies regarding leaves of absence.

## Vacation Leave

Employees are entitled to an unlimited number of paid vacation days per year, which can be used for rest, relaxation, and personal pursuits. The specific number of vacation days and the process for requesting and managing them are outlined in this policy.

## Sick Leave

We understand that employees may occasionally require time off due to illness or injury. Sick leave allows employees to take time to recover and take care of their health. The sick leave policy provides details on entitlements, reporting procedures, and any medical documentation requirements.

## Parental Leave

We believe in supporting employees who are expanding their families. Our parental leave policy outlines the provisions for maternity, paternity, and adoption leave, including the duration of leave, eligibility criteria, and any benefits or arrangements available during this time.

## Family and Medical Leave

In certain situations, employees may require time off to care for their own or their family members' serious health conditions. Our family and medical leave policy provides information on eligibility, leave duration, and the process for requesting and managing this type of leave.

## Bereavement Leave

During times of loss, we recognize the need for employees to take time off to grieve and make necessary arrangements. Our bereavement leave policy outlines the entitlements and procedures for requesting bereavement leave due to the loss of a loved one.
