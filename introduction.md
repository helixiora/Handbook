# Introduction

Welcome to Helixiora!

At Helixiora, we are passionate about leveraging cloud, data, and AI technologies to drive innovation and growth for our clients. Our mission is to empower businesses to thrive in the digital age by providing cutting-edge infrastructure solutions and exceptional service.

## Our Purpose
We exist to create flow and remove impediments in the organisation of people, processes and technology.

## Our Values

**Autonomy is growth** - We have a collaborative culture of teaching people how to fish - clients and colleagues alike. Each of us works toward personal growth, while respecting others’ diversity of skills and styles. 

**Speak honestly and act with fairness** - We are honest about what we can and cannot do, what is technically possible or morally acceptable. We work on mutual trust, understanding and the belief that all people are equally important.

**We are more than our work** -  We feel the freedom to make work playful. Learning, playing, experimenting and fun are embedded in who we are – we can be our full selves.

We are thrilled to have you join our team, and we look forward to working together to achieve great things!
