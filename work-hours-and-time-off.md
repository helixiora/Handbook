# Work Hours and Time Off

At Helixiora, we believe in fostering a healthy work-life balance and providing flexibility to our employees. This section outlines our policies regarding work hours and time off.

## Regular Working Hours

Our regular working hours are flexible. Employees are expected to be present during agreed upon hours unless alternative arrangements have been made with their supervisor. It is important to fulfill job responsibilities and collaborate effectively with team members.

## Flexible Work Arrangements

We understand that work preferences may vary, and we support flexible work arrangements. This may include remote work, flextime, or compressed workweek options. Employees interested in exploring flexible work arrangements should discuss their preferences with their supervisor and obtain the necessary approvals.

## Time Off and Leave

At Helixiora, we provide various types of time off and leave to support personal well-being and life events. This includes vacation leave, sick leave, parental leave, and other statutory leaves in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. The process for requesting and managing time off and leave is outlined in the [Leaves of Absence](leaves-of-absence.md) policy.

## Public Holidays

We observe public holidays based on the local regulations of each country where we operate. The specific public holiday schedule will be communicated to employees annually, and they will be entitled to time off on these designated holidays.
